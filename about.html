                            <p> TED is building a clearinghouse of free knowledge from the world's most inspired thinkers — and a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other, both online and at TED and TEDx events around the world, all year long.
                              </p>
                             <p> What started as a small idea grew out to change the world for the good. TED at its core believes that the stem of every great idea is an inspiration and TED tries to spark and ignite this inspiration by sharing heart touching, inspiring and motivational stories. Over the decades of inspiring budding minds, TED has achieved recognition throughout the world.
                              </p>

                           <p>The community voice of TED takes the form of TEDx where x represents “independently organised event” under the license of TED. 
                            </p> 
                            <p>TEDx events are organized by curious individuals who seek to discover ideas and spark conversations in their own community. It is a platform to reach more people at the community level. </p>
                         </p>    
                         <p>Each community has its heroes, people that are constantly yearning to create, explore, imagine new ideas. TEDx aims to bring these people together and give them a stage, so they can share their story, for other people to create their own and give something to the world.</p>
